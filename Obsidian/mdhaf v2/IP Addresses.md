- IPv4 (32 bit) - Uses Decimal versus IPv6 (128 bit) uses Hex
- In IPv6, zeros can be omitted
- Routing Prefix is 1st 64 bits of IPv4, 2nd 64 bits is Interface ID
- Network Address Translation (NAT) provides a low level of security
- Private IP Blocks (Non-routable):
- ==A - 10.0.0.0/8 ==
- ==B - 172.16.0.0/12 & 172.31.255.25/12==
- ==C - 192.168.0.0==

Classless Inter Domain Routing

192.168.

MAC Addresses are 48 Bit
IPv6 Prefix denotes the address
Extended Unique Identifier 64 (EUI 64) - Add FFFE to the middle of IPv6 in the middle of the MAC address it has

Link Local/ Unique local address/ Unicast, Multicast, Anycast - IPv6 address types
Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) - Differentiating different services in hierarchy with a Precedence Code that assigned a High to Low priority to drop packets.
